# Gesture Control
GESTURE COTROL MESSAGE CONVEYOR 

The main objective of our project is for those patient who are been diagnose with paralytic problem. These people are unable to communicate using their voice and are only able to move their limbs to an extent. We place a sensor on one of their moving limbs, and for each movement, a message would be displayed on the LCD and sounds would be transmitted from the buzzer for different movements. So that they can communicate with the help of this device.
